The Subsidy Immunity Formula (SIF)An Optimal Stopping Framework for Retail Mean Reversion StrategiesAuthor: Emmanuel NormabuenaAffiliation: Independent Researcher / Systems ArchitectLocation: Santiago, ChileDate: January 2026📄 AbstractRetail investors frequently suffer from the Disposition Effect, holding losing positions due to a lack of explicit opportunity cost quantification. This repository hosts the technical whitepaper and reference implementation for the Subsidy Immunity Formula (SIF).The SIF model is derived from the Principle of Indifference and solves the implicit circularity of first-passage time probabilities. By algebraically isolating the volatility time horizon from the Reflection Principle equation, we define two novel metrics:Intrinsic Duration ($D_i$): The linear sensitivity of funding capital.Dynamic Convexity ($C$): The quadratic penalty imposed by volatility.The interaction of these terms determines the Strategic Shielding Time (SST), identifying the critical "Log-Moneyness" barrier ($\delta_{crit}$) where a position becomes mathematically insolvent.🧩 Key DefinitionsThe framework establishes the following canonical equation for optimal stopping:$$SST = (D_i \cdot \delta) - (C(\delta) \cdot \delta^2)$$Where:$D_i = 1/r$ (Inverse of the risk-free rate)$C(\delta) = \frac{1}{[\sigma \cdot \text{EC}(\delta)]^2}$ (Volatility penalty scaled by the Exigence Coefficient)📂 Repository ContentsQuant_Whitepaper.pdf: The complete technical paper explaining the derivation, proofs, and scenario analysis (Hawk vs. Panic regimes).sif_model.py: Python reference implementation. It replicates the figures found in the paper, simulating the SST collapse and calculating the Greeks ($\rho_{sif}$, $\nu_{sif}$).🚀 Quick StartTo run the simulation and generate the sensitivity graphs, execute the following commands in your terminal:git clone https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/SIF-Model.gitcd SIF-Modelpython sif_model.py⚖️ License & Legal WarningCopyright © 2026 Emmanuel Normabuena.
